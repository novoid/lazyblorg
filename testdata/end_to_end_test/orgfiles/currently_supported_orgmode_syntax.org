** Basic Text Formatting
:PROPERTIES:
:CREATED:  [2014-01-30 Thu 16:33]
:END:

This is *bold* and *bold case*. And this is ~teletype style~.

=And= this is inline =verbatim= text also on the end of a =line=

Examples with line-breaks in between: *This is a bold sentence which
has a line break*.

*** not yet implemented                                      :noexport:

and /italic/ and _underlined_ and +strikethrough+

: This is a verbose statement.
: With a second line.
:    ... and a third one http://heise.de *not bold* foobar

** Comment Lines Starting With Hashes
:PROPERTIES:
:CREATED:  [2015-05-25 Mon 13:56]
:END:

According to [[http://orgmode.org/manual/Comment-lines.html][the org-mode manual]], lines starting with the character
'#' should be ignored.

# This is not part of the output
#  This is not part of the output

** URLs

Without brackets: http://heise.de

With brackets and no description: [[http://heise.de]]

With brackets and a description: [[http://heise.de][heise]]

URLs with line breaks within: this is a very tough example of [[https://github.com/novoid/lazyblorg][an url
like this which is very long]].

Multiple URLs in one line: http://heise.de [[http://heise.de]] [[http://heise.de][heise]]

** Links to IDs
:PROPERTIES:

** Deprecated HTML-blocks
:PROPERTIES:
:CREATED:  [2014-01-30 Thu 15:09]

Previous to Org-mode version 8, HTML blocks could be defined like:

#+BEGIN_HTML

       line comment -->
  <b>This is without any title</b>
</p>
#+END_HTML

#+NAME: Example HTML snippet
#+BEGIN_HTML

** COLON-blocks
:PROPERTIES:

This is how a colon-block looks like in Org-mode:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE

: This is *bold* and ~teletype~ with an URL https://github.com/novoid/lazyblorg and such.

This is what lazyblorg does with it:

** Lists
:PROPERTIES:

Simple lists:

- first line
- second line
  - another list in a list
  - don't get confused
    - even more lists
    - bah!
- back to first list

Ordered lists with multi-line items:

1. first line
2. second line
   1. another list in a list with very long lines that are too long
      for one line; in fact, [[http://example.org/testlink][this list item]] spans over a couple of
      lines - more than even two of them
   2. don't get confused
      1. even more lists
      2. bah!
3. back to first list

Mixed lists:

1. first line
2. second line
   - another list in a list
   - don't get confused
     1. even more lists
     2. bah!
3. back to first list

** Customized Link Images

These are some beautiful photographs I want to include here:

[[tsfile:2017-03-11T18.29.21 Sterne im Baum -- mytag.jpg]]

[[tsfile:2017-03-11T18.29.21 Sterne im Baum -- mytag.jpg][2017-03-11T18.29.21 Sterne im Baum -- mytag.jpg]]

[[tsfile:2017-03-11T18.29.21%20Sterne%20im%20Baum%20--%20mytag.jpg][A completely different description here]]

And now we do test images with captions and attributes. Here is an
image with a caption and attributes for =alt=, =title= (ignored),
=align=, and =width=:

#+CAPTION: Some beautiful stars in a tree
#+ATTR_HTML: :alt Stars in a Tree :title Some Stars :align right :width 300
[[tsfile:2017-03-11T18.29.21%20Sterne%20im%20Baum%20--%20mytag.jpg][2017-03-11T18.29.21 Sterne im Baum -- mytag.jpg]]

If you define multiple caption lines, only the last one is used in the result:

#+CAPTION: Multiple captions do not hurt but the last one wins
#+CAPTION: This is the only caption for this image.
#+ATTR_HTML: :alt An alternative description image :title This is my title! :align right :width 300
[[tsfile:2017-03-11T18.29.21 Sterne im Baum -- mytag.jpg]]

Of course, you can use multiple =ATTR_HTML= lines to define multiple
parameters in multiple lines. Following example consists of three
lines. First: =alt=. Second: =title= (still ignored). Third: =align=
and =width=.

Notice when there is a =CAPTION=, the description of the Org-mode link
gets ignored. I do think that if you invest effort to define an extra
line for it, it should replace the Org-mode description. Usually,
you're not going to use both.

#+CAPTION: This caption will be overwritten by follow-up ones
#+CAPTION: This is going to be the caption
#+ATTR_HTML: :alt This is going to be the alt parameter of the img tag
#+ATTR_HTML: :title The title is ignored
#+ATTR_HTML: :align right :width 300
[[tsfile:2017-03-11T18.29.21%20Sterne%20im%20Baum%20--%20mytag.jpg][If there is an CAPTION, this title gets ignored]]

This is a real-world example: An Org-mode link with its description
(used for caption) with attributes for =alt=, =align=, and =width=:

#+ATTR_HTML: :alt This is going to be the alt parameter of the img tag
#+ATTR_HTML: :title The title is ignored
#+ATTR_HTML: :align right :width 300
[[tsfile:2017-03-11T18.29.21%20Sterne%20im%20Baum%20--%20mytag.jpg][This is the caption of the image]]

If you want to justify the images, you can do it with =:align
left= like in the following example:

#+CAPTION: Test for left-justified image with 300px width
#+ATTR_HTML: :alt left-justified stars
#+ATTR_HTML: :align left :width 300
[[tsfile:2017-03-11T18.29.21 Sterne im Baum -- mytag.jpg]]

Same example but with =:align center=:

#+CAPTION: Test for center-justified image with 300px width
#+ATTR_HTML: :alt center-justified stars
#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :width 300
[[tsfile:2017-03-11T18.29.21 Sterne im Baum -- mytag.jpg]]

And of course, there is the =:align right= example as well:

#+CAPTION: Test for right-justified image with 300px width
#+ATTR_HTML: :alt right-justified stars
#+ATTR_HTML: :align right :width 300
[[tsfile:2017-03-11T18.29.21 Sterne im Baum -- mytag.jpg]]

Following example is a really smart one. Above file names were
=2017-03-11T18.29.21 Sterne im Baum -- mytag.jpg=. This time, I am
using =2017-03-11T18.29.21.jpg= which matches the very same time-stamp
of the other image file. The rest of it differs: missing =Sterne im
Baum -- mytag=. In case an image file (containing a time-stamp) is not
found, lazyblorg tries to locate the same time-stamp within a
different file-name. If the result is unique, it is used instead of
the other filename. You get a warning in the log output.

#+CAPTION: Test with image file whose name only matches the ISO timestamp (partial comparison)
#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :width 300
[[tsfile:2017-03-11T18.29.21.jpg]]

Small images are really sexy when the text is floating around. Try the
=:align float-right= attribute:

#+CAPTION: Image float right
#+ATTR_HTML: :align float-right :width 100
[[tsfile:2017-03-11T18.29.21.jpg]]

This is an example text. This is an example text. This is an example
text. This is an example text. This is an example text. This is an

[[tsfile:2017-03-11T18.29.21.jpg]]
