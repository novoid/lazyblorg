## According to https://github.com/novoid/lazyblorg/wiki/Images
## you can link to a differently sized image when including a

## In order to give the page reader a hint that there is actually

## larger) size, you can define help texts here.
## Note: there is a dependency to Utils.STOPWORDS for the detected
## languages for the blog article (auto-tags). Therefore, the following
## dict has to map defined languages to the texts. If you need
## another language, you need to make sure the auto-tag mechanism
## within Utils is extended as well and the language identifier
## matches the dict keys below.
