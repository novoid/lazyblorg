- problem:
  - keep a sorted list of elements like [ [<time-stamp>,<id>], [...] ]

- http://wiki.python.org/moin/HowTo/Sorting/
  - sorting by index or named attribute!

Sorting by age using tuples:
#+BEGIN_SRC python
>>> student_tuples = [
        ('john', 'A', 15),
        ('jane', 'B', 12),
        ('dave', 'B', 10),
]
>>> sorted(student_tuples, key=lambda student: student[2])   # sort by age
[('dave', 'B', 10), ('jane', 'B', 12), ('john', 'A', 15)]
#+END_SRC

Sorting by attribute of a class:
#+BEGIN_SRC python
>>> class Student:
        def __init__(self, name, grade, age):
                self.name = name
                self.grade = grade
                self.age = age
        def __repr__(self):
                return repr((self.name, self.grade, self.age))

>>> student_objects = [
        Student('john', 'A', 15),
        Student('jane', 'B', 12),
        Student('dave', 'B', 10),
]
>>> sorted(student_objects, key=lambda student: student.age)   # sort by age
[('dave', 'B', 10), ('jane', 'B', 12), ('john', 'A', 15)]

- article mentions following:

- open questions

  - [X] how to tell width/height?
    - http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/images-and-xhtml-export.html
      : #+ATTR_HTML: alt="Zoomed image."
      : #+ATTR_HTML: width="300" style="border:2px solid black;"
      : #+ATTR_HTML: style="float:left;"
      : [[image]]
    - multiple attr-lines per image
      - RegEx: "#+ATTR_HTML: " followed by one or more "alt=[...]", "width=[...]", "height=[...]", "style=[...]"
      - alt -> write directly to alt attribute
      - width/height -> write directly to width/height attribute
      - style -> write directly to style attribute

  - [ ] create yasnippet file with attr line with drop-downs for
    common values
    - [ ] three standard-sizes?
      - small = xx em
      - medium = 50% textwidth
      - big = textwidth

  - [ ] scaling images -> probably future feature instead of here!
    - if scaled, add its size-identifier to original file name
      - "2014-01-29 file name.png" -> "2014-01-29 file name - scaled 42em.png"
      - makes it possible to use same file with different scaling
        sizes

- procedure
  1. [ ] additional parameter of files.org_archive
  2. parse files.org_archive on first usage of tsfile link
     - RegEx: [FILENAME] (with brackets!)
     - create global look-up dict: filename -> path
  3. get file location
     - add as list element in dict "payload"
     - this makes multiple paths per item possible!
  4. error if file not found
     - probably: re-try alternative path if file was found multiple times
  5. in case of article:
     - put file in article folder
     - link locally (relative path)
  6. in case of non-article (persistent, tag, ...):
     - put file in global folder named "tsfile" in root
     - link wirh absolute path

*** Idea: parse content test cases from Org file

A file like «tests.org» contains test cases, each one in a
heading. if it starts with «test: » it is a test case followed by its
test name.

A sub-heading «Org» contains the Org-mode document/snippet which gets
parsed.

A sub-heading «result» contains the results which is expected.

** SOMEDAY [#C] Pre-search for new blog articles before invoking lazyblorg :userstory:

- do a "egrep '^\*+ .*:blog:' | wc -l" and compare with last number
  - if changed, run lazyblorg
  - if not changed, do nothing
- does not work when same number of blog articles get deleted as
  created in between
- probably add this to best practice or FAQs

- e.g.:
  - www.example.com/blog/i/aB3 ->
  - www.example.com/i/aB3 ->
- generate short URL as hash from ID?
  - is it possible without getting a high chance of conflicts?
    - YES:
      - use 4-letter-part of sha1-hash
      - before storing, check on conflict with existing one
        - use creation-date as first-come-first-serve
        - in case of conflict: add more sha1-letters to short-URL

- [2013-08-29 Thu]: idea: www.example.com/s(.html)#ID
  - one (long) HTML page with links to all pages
    - large space between entries such that entries can not be mixed
      up (showing multiple entries the same time)
    - disadvantage: user has to click on the URL of the article
  - working: /index.shtml#realcontent
    - www.example.com/s.html#ID
  - working: /#realcontent
    - www.example.com/s/#ID
    - *shorter!*

For optimizing performance and RAM usage: use *two parsing processes*:

  1. find new or updated articles
     - parse for used ID-links
     - collect and store metadata of these (everything except content)
     - print out warnings for all IDs that are broken links
     - create creative 404-page for all broken links in the meantime

  2. parse everything again and store only new or updated article contents
     - match with ID-links
** SOMEDAY [#C] do not parse HTML template file if unchanged  :architecture:

** Naming this project
:PROPERTIES:
:CREATED:  [2013-08-20 Tue 10:18]
:END:

lazyblorg - a mixture of lazy, blogging, blog, org-mode - emphasizes
the fact that the *user* of it may be very lazy. This relates to the
minimal effort she/he has to do in order to create a new blog entry.

There are no hits in [[https://www.google.com/#fp%3De12793cfcde69436&hl%3Den&nfpr%3D1&q%3Dlazyblorg&safe%3Doff][Google search for "lazyblorg"]]. However, there
are some for "lazyblog" (without the 'r').

- Other cool names would be:
  - invisiblorg
    - invisible, blog, org-mode
    - emphasizes the invisibility of the blog mechanism once it is
      set up
    - no hits for "[[https://www.google.com/#fp%3De12793cfcde69436&hl%3Den&nfpr%3D1&q%3Dinvisiblorg&safe%3Doff][invisiblorg]]" but some for "invisiblog" or "invisibl.org"

- lazyblorg.py
  - central module which uses all other modules
  - handles command line parameters
  - calls parser
  - gets template data
  - pushes data to htmlizer
- lib/utils.py
  - misc (static) tool-methods that are or might get handy for other
    modules as well
- lib/orgformat.py
  - borrowed from the [[https://github.com/novoid/Memacs][Memacs]] project
  - holds all kind of cool tool-methods to generate Org-mode stuff
    (time-stamps, ...)
- lib/orgparser.py
  - parses an Org-mode file and returns an internal representation of
    matching sections
- lib/htmlizer.py
  - responsible for everything between internal representation of blog
    stuff to create to their resulting files on the hard disk (HTML,
    CSS, ...)

NOTE: OrgParser is using "par" for anything it can not interpret as
something else.

[fn:earmarked] Planned to be implemented soon (or at all :-)

[fn:lowprio] This feature is low on my personal development list (way
take some time or might never get implemented)

[fn:internalrepresentation] usually in list: ~blog_data['id-of-entry']['content']~

For a complete list of *content elements*, please take a look at
id:implemented-org-elements (above)

~blog_data~ is a Python list containing one dictionary entry per blog entry:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  blog_data = \
  [ {'level': 2,                                                ## number of asterisks
     'title': u'This is a blog entry about foo', 
     'tags': [u'tag1', u'tag2'], 
     'id': u'lazyblorg-example-entry',                          ## ID from PROPERTIES-drawer
     'finished-timestamp-history': [datetime1, datetime2, datetime3],
     'timestamp': datetime,                                    ## most current time-stamp
     'created: datetime,
     'content': [ ['par', u'This is the Org-mode content'],    ## 'par: paragraph containing anything that is not defined like tables, ...
                  '\n',    ## change of paragraph
                  ['heading', {'level': 3, 'title': u'Another aspect'}],  
                  ['html-block', 'its name or None', [u'first line', u'second line', u'', u'last line']],
                  ['list-itemize', [u'first line', u'second line']],
                  ['table', u'followed by this table data'],         #FIXXME: table syntax
                  ['image', u'followed by this image']               #FIXXME: image syntax
                ]                                                    #FIXXME: further elements
  } ]
#+END_SRC

Thus:
#+BEGIN_SRC python
blog_data[0].keys()
## ... results in:
# ['title',
#  'timestamp',
#  'created',
#  'tags',
#  'content',
#  'finished-timestamp-history',
#  'level',
#  'id']

blog_data[0]['content']  ## -> list of elements of content
# [['text', u'This is the Org-mode content'],
#  ['heading', {'level': 3, 'title': u'Another aspect'}],
#  ['list-itemize', [u'first line', u'second line']],
#  ['table', u'FIXXME: followed by this table data'],
#  ['image', u'FIXXME: followed by this image']]
#+END_SRC
** Internal format of meta-data 
:PROPERTIES:
:CREATED:  [2013-08-22 Thu 21:08]
:END:

Example:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
>>> metadata
{u'2013-08-22-testid': {'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2013, 8, 22, 21, 6), 'checksum': 'b757f8478bffd6c70a474f213d6520de', 'created': datetime.datetime(2013, 8, 22, 21, 6)}, 
 u'2013-02-12-lazyblorg-example-entry': {'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2013, 2, 14, 19, 2), 'checksum': '24af2246a5121e829a0dbbd6e2425c15', 'created': datetime.datetime(2013, 2, 12, 10, 58)}}
#+END_EXAMPLE

Keys of the dict: IDs of the entries:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
>>> metadata.keys()
[u'2013-08-22-testid', u'2013-02-12-lazyblorg-example-entry']
#+END_EXAMPLE

One entry with key=ID holds a dict with following entries:
- 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2013, 8, 22, 21, 6)
  - most recent time-stamp from the LOGBOOK drawer which marked going
    to a final state
- 'checksum': 'b757f8478bffd6c70a474f213d6520de'
  - md5 check-sum of: [title, tags, finished_timestamp_history, content]
- 'created': datetime.datetime(2013, 8, 22, 21, 6)
  - datetime object of the CREATED property from the PROPERTY drawer
  - [ ] FIXXME: why not the first CLOSED time-stamp?
** Time-stamps
:PROPERTIES:
:CREATED:  [2014-02-01 Sat 20:04]
:ID: 2014-02-01-time-stamps
:END:

Example:

: CLOSED: [2014-01-31 Fri 14:02]
: :LOGBOOK:
: - State "DONE"       from "DONE"       [2014-02-01 Sat 18:42]
: - State "DONE"       from ""           [2014-01-30 Thu 14:02]
: :END:
: :PROPERTIES:
: :CREATED:  [2014-01-28 Tue 14:02]
: :ID: 2014-01-27-lb-tests
: :END:

What happens with the various time-stamps?

- most recent LOGBOOK entry of setting to DONE:
  - added to entry['finished-timestamp-history'] (which is a list)
  - overwrites entry['timestamp'] if is newer than the old one
    - entry['timestamp'] is the most recent LOGBOOK entry of setting
      to DONE
- CREATED:
  - entry['created']
- CLOSED:
  - ignored
- ID-timestamp:
  - ignored

After parsing entry from above:

- entry['created'] = [2014-01-28 Tue 14:02]
- entry['timestamp'] = [2014-02-01 Sat 18:42]
- entry['finished-timestamp-history'] = [2014-02-01 Sat 18:42] and
  [2014-01-30 Thu 14:02]

Oldest entry of entry['finished-timestamp-history'] is the publication time-stamp!


** Development Schedule
:PROPERTIES:
:CREATED:  [2012-11-05 Mon 10:59]
:END:

this is the plan (from 2012-11):

- manually generate demo prototype
  - very basic Org-mode example file containing everything from below
  - HTML5 entry page
  - CSS2 style
  - HTML5 blog entry page
  - Tag description page
  - RSS feed
  - HTML5 blog entry page with update
  - Index overview page (archive)
  - description of basic work-flow for generating the blog
    - user point of view
    - system point of view
- refine and test design and features of prototype
  - ask for feedback
  - play around, break things
- development
  - define order of Org-mode items (headings, lists, images, ...) implementation priority
  - define even more basic (Org-mode, HTML) from above
  - very basic unit-tests from prototype files (Org-mode, HTML)
  - test and refine work-flow for (re-)generating the blog
  - implement more and more Org-mode items

    - optionally: generate calendar archive page(s)
    - optionally: generate tag overview page(s)
  - on any error:
    - create an orgmode event from current time that appears on agenda
    - with daily repeat -> so it gets noticed on the next day(s) too
    - in the description of that entry:
      - babel-sh-snippet with prepared command to re-try the run :-)

** Original post (How this all started)

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Hi!

I got a nice idea on how a very easy to use Org-mode blog system
should look like.

Currently, I am using Serendipidy with web-based editor to write
HTML. Org-mode enabled me to write blog entries and export it to
HTML. Then I paste the HTML and have to modify minor things (images,
...) a bit. I guess the time from finishing the Org-mode entry to
the final blog entry is approximately ten to twenty minutes.

Overall, I do not want to do this process when I just want to
quickly write a view paragraphs within a couple of minutes. I need
a workflow with much less annoying overhead.

Therefore I sat down and thought about a workflow that should be
enough for writing simple weblog entries:

  - create an Org-mode heading (anywhere!)
  - make sure that there is an (uniq) :ID: property
  - add the tag :blog: to heading
  - <write content, subheadings, ...>
  - change state of top-heading to DONE
    - this enables blog entries «in the queue»
  - (manually) invoke generation-script

This enables me quick blogging with a list of advantages:

  - a blog entry can be located anywhere in all of my Orgmode files
  - no extra formatting steps
  - very small (almost non-existent) overhead to create a blog entry
  - no duplicate information
    - updates only in Orgmode, not HTML or any in-between format
  - static (fast) pages
  - self-hosting without any fancy services behind like RDBS

What do you think of my ideas so far?

Of course, I looked into existing solutions and found those:

  - http://orgmode.org/worg/org-blog-wiki.html
    - cool overview page for various solutions
  - http://orgmode.org/worg/blorgit.html
    - pretty complex set up :-(
    - I do not need a web-interface to edit Org-mode files
    - seem to have «different» use cases
  - http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-jekyll.html
    - uses HTML as in-between format; seems to provide many error
      possibilities(?)
    - converting whole files only (not desired)
    - have to try it someday
  - http://emacs-fu.blogspot.com/2009/05/writing-and-blogging-with-org-mode.html
    - uses only HTML export
  - http://blog.herraiz.org/archives/241
    - uses only HTML export
  - https://github.com/chrismgray/ikiwiki-org-plugin
    - promising but only one part of a possible solution

So nothing offers the features and small footprint as my idea above
:-(

With some prerequisites, it should not be that hard to even
implement it by myself:

  - usage of only very basic markup
    - paragraphs (p)
    - headings (h1..n)
    - http-references (a href)
    - lists (ul)
    - images (img)
    - quote (verbatim)

Still there are some open issues:

  - comments
    - simplest form: generate unique Email link and add at bottom
      - very easy to be done for catch-all MTAs
      - automatically derive whitelist for MTA to avoid old spam
    - simple HTML form
      - POST to script, adding comment to my inbox.org (containing
        link to ID)
    - disqus: I do not want to outsource comment hosting :-(
  - how to include and format graphics?
    - sometimes, I e.g. want to have an image aligned right with text
      flowing around it
  - probably: usage of in-between format like ikiwiki
    - Orgmode syntax -> ikiwiki markup (markdown?) -> usual
      ikiwiki-workflow
      - should be not much effort since prerequisites limit to few
        markup things
    - benefits from not having to re-implement many things
    - in-between-format HTML (like Manoj uses) is way too complicated
      causing misc potential error sources

The basic script workflow is not that complicated:

  - find all headings with state DONE and tag :blog:
    - optionally: add all other tags starting with "blog-" as blog tags
  - one entry starts at such a heading until EOF OR same or less level
    heading is found
  - compare raw text and IDs with last run
    - known ID, raw text unchanged: ignore, no change
    - new ID
      - generate new blog entry
        - extract YYYY-MM-DD from LOGBOOK-drawer (first *->DONE transformation)
        - generate YYYY/MM/DD-folder structure in blog accordingly
        - generate sanitized blog title as file name
    - known ID, raw text differs
      - generate update of existing entry
        - add "(Update n)" (with n is the n-th update) to entry title
          - optionally: add this also to URL
            - disadvantage: broken old URLs
            - advantage: URL reflects update state
  - on any activity:
    - re-write RSS feed for last n entries
    - optionally: generate overview page for last n entries
    - optionally: generate calendar archive page(s)
    - optionally: generate tag overview page(s)
